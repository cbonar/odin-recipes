              <li>1/2 cup light brown sugar</li>
              <li>1 egg, at room temperature</li>
          </ul>
        <p>For the Espresso Buttercream Frosting: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup unsalted butter, at room temperature</li>
            <li>2 1/2 cups powdered sugar</li>
            <li>1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1 1/2 teaspoons espresso powder</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Instructions</h4>
        <p>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat your oven to 350 degrees fahrenheit. Line a standard sized muffin tin with cupcake liners.</li>
                <li>For the Cupcakes: In a measuring cup, whisk the espresso powder into the brewed coffee until completely dissolved. Add the milk and the vanilla extract; 
                    set aside.</li>
                <li>In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, cocoa powder, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.</li>
                <li>With an electric mixer on medium speed, beat the butter and both sugars until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes. Add the egg and beat until combined. Reduce the
                     mixer speed to low and add the flour mixture in three additions, alternating with two additions of coffee mixture, mixing each until just combined. Using a rubber
                      spatula, scrape the sides and make sure everything is well incorporated.</li>
                <li>Fill each muffin cup about two-thirds full with batter. Bake for 17-20 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. Cool completely before 
                    frosting.</li>
                <li>For the Frosting: In a small bowl, whisk the espresso powder into the vanilla until dissolved; set aside.</li>
                <li>Using the whisk attatchment of a stand mixer, whip the butter on medium-high speed for about 5 minutes, stopping once to scrape the sides of the bowl. Reduce the 
                    powdered sugar a little at a time, waiting until it is mostly incorporated before adding more. Once all of the powdered sugar has been added, scrape the sides of the bowl 
                    and increase the speed to medium-high speed and whip until fluffy, about 1 to 2 minutes. Add the espresso and vanilla mixture and continue to mix at medium-high speeds until 
                    it is completely incorporated, scraping the sides as necessary. Frost as desired and enjoy!</li>
