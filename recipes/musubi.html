        <h3>Salty. Sweet. Savory. Musubi is an All-in-One meal!</h3>
        <p>I know, I know, <strong>spam</strong> really!? Trust me that's what I thought the first time too.
        However, if you give it a shot, you might just like it. Spam is a very popular ingredient in China, used in all sorts of dishes such as, Hot Pot, Spam Omelettes, and Spam and pepper stir fry.
    Musubi is also a great way to get your little ones to test their skills in the kitchen by helping shape the rice and wrapping the nori. If all else fails, throw it all together and have a Musubi bowl!</p>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <p> <ul>
        <li>1 teaspoon vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 can Spam, sliced into 8 pieces</li>
        <li>1/4 cup water</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons soy sauce</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons sugar</li>
        <li>4 cups cooked sushi rice</li>
        <li>3 sheets roasted seaweed nori, cut into 8 strips about 2" wide and 9" long</li>
    </ul></p>
    <h4>Instructions</h4>
    <p>
        <ol>
            <li>Start making steamed rice (or sushi rice).</li>
            <li>Heat a 12-inch nonstick or well seasoned cast-iron skillet over medium heat. Add the Spam slices and cook until browned and crisp on the bottom side, 2 to 3 minutes. Flip and cook until the other side is also browned and 
                crisp, 2 to 3 minutes.</li>
            <li>Whisk together the water and soy sauce in a small bowl. Sprinkle the sugar evenly over the Spam slices, then add the soy sauce mixture. Swirl to evenly distribute, then let the Spam simmer until
                  the liquid is nearly absorbed, 3 to 4 minutes. Flip once in between, so the sugar will melt completely and carmalize well. Transfer the Spam slices to a plate to cool.</li>
            <li>To make the sushi: Place one slice of Spam perpendicular to the nori strip on the bottom of the strip (forming a cross shape). Wet the palms and fingers of both hands, measure 1/2 cup of rice, and transfer the rice into 
                      your palm. Use both hands to firmly press the rice into a ball. Then hold the rice ball with your left hand, with your thumb and the other four fingers to secure both sides, use your right hand to gently press the rice 
                      ball into a rectangular shape about the size of the Spam slice. Place the rice on top of the Spam. Roll up the Spam and rice to let the nori sheet wrap around it. Seal the end with a bit of water and place the musubi seam-side 
                      down while you work on the rest. Repeat with the remaining nori strips, Spam, and rice. Remember to rinse your hands every time, to minimize rice sticking to your hands.</li>
            <li>Enjoy the Spam musubi immediately at room temperature. You can store them in an airtight container or wrap them in plastic wrap and place them in the fridge. To serve refrigerated musubi, warm them in the microwave for 20 seconds or so, 
                to get the best texture.</li>
