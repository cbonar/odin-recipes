        <h3>Salty. Sweet. Savory. Musubi is an All-in-One meal!</h3>
        <p>I know, I know, <strong>spam</strong> really!? Trust me that's what I thought the first time too.
        However, if you give it a shot, you might just like it. Spam is a very popular ingredient in China, used in all sorts of dishes such as, Hot Pot, Spam Omelettes, and Spam and pepper stir fry.
    Musubi is also a great way to get your little ones to test their skills in the kitchen by helping shape the rice and wrapping the nori. If all else fails, throw it all together and have a Musubi bowl!</p>
